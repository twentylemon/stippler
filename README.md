# stippler

Implementation of weighted voronoi stippling. As of now, the program logic is done, but the program requires recompiling in order to run for a different image. This was done as an assignment, so simplicity was a factor. I may return to this later to integrate Concorde directly and add command line parameters for automation and such.
